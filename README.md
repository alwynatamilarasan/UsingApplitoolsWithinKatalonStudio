Walking through Applitools Eyes Demo within Katalon Studio
===========

# What is this?

This is a simple Katalon Studio project for demonstration purpose. You can check this out onto your PC and execute with your Katalon Studio.

# Why I made this

I have created a Katalon project here. In this demo project, a Katalon Test Case invokes Applitools Eyes API. It seems successfully working. But I am not fully confident of its feasibility due to some reasons --- I will describe my concern later.
